# How to Work With Me

## My Core Principles

### 1. Trust Is Being Paid Upfront
When you join my team, you start with my full trust, you don’t need to earn it first.
I assume you care, you want to do great work, and you take responsibility.
Our relationship starts from that foundation, and we build from there.

### 2. Bias Toward Action
Progress beats perfection. When something is unclear, take a small step.
Build something, test something, draft something, momentum creates clarity.

### 3. Always Assume Positive Intent
Confusion comes from missing context, not bad intentions.
If something feels off, start with curiosity.
Ask questions. Seek understanding first.
I’ll always do the same with you.

## What I Value Most: Ownership
The strongest people I’ve worked with all have a deep sense of ownership.
To me, that means:
- Taking initiative without waiting to be asked.
- Actively understanding how your work supports the team’s goals.
- Prioritizing the team win over the personal win.
- Making decisions that connect customer value with sustainable revenue.

Great work is impactful work, not just completed tasks.

## How I Make Decisions
- I optimize for good decisions made at the right time.
- Reflection should focus on what we knew then, not what we know now.
- Failures are part of learning, and learning is non‑negotiable.

I’d rather we try something, learn from it, and iterate, than stay stuck discussing possibilities.

## Feedback: Giving and Receiving
I value honest, thoughtful feedback.
If something I do doesn’t work for you or for the team, please tell me.
If saying it directly feels uncomfortable, share it in a way that works for you, including through someone else.

Feedback helps us all grow. Silence doesn’t.

## What I Expect From You
- Manage your manager, tell me what you need.
- If you want something, ask. The worst answer you’ll get is “let’s discuss it later.”
- Communicate clearly and make your impact visible.
- Bring passion, curiosity, and initiative.
- When you see a problem, come with options or approaches.
- Don’t get discouraged if your idea isn’t chosen. One great idea will outweigh many that weren’t picked.

## What You Can Expect From Me
- I will support you, unblock you, and give you space to grow.
- I will be transparent in my reasoning and decision-making.
- I will give you context and trust you with autonomy from the start.
- I will create an environment where you can do great work and take ownership confidently.

## Final Thought
Our best work happens when we move with intention, take ownership, assume positive intent, and stay focused on creating real value.
My job is to help you do the best work of your career, and your job is to tell me what you need to get there.
